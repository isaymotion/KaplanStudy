# Chapter 29 (End-of-Life Issues and Palliative Care) — drafting spec

You are writing study content for a psychiatry-resident web app built from Kaplan & Sadock's *Synopsis of Psychiatry*, 12th ed., Chapter 29 (sections 29.1 and 29.3 in this release). Your source is ONLY the text file(s) named in your prompt (extracted from the book). Do not add facts from memory or other sources. Do not paste book sentences: rewrite everything in plain, short sentences in the app's own words.

## Style rules (strict)
- Plain, short sentences. No jargon beyond the book's terms.
- **Bold** the key facts a resident must recall (numbers, names, criteria, drug names, key words). Bold becomes a fill-in blank in "Hide key facts" mode, so bold the *answer*, not the question word. Every table cell or list item should contain at most a few bolded phrases.
- Ranges in prose use "to" ("6 to 12 months"), never a hyphen or en dash between numbers. Percentages: "20 percent" in prose, "20%" in tables.
- Where a table cell or sentence in the source text is garbled or cut off, use only what is clearly legible. Never invent text to fill a gap.
- Refer to the book's tables and figures by number in captions ("(Table 29-2)") so the reader can find them.
- Clinical vignettes in the book become `case` blocks (paraphrased, shortened, de-identified; keep the diagnosis the book gives).
- No post-publication updates, no `update` blocks: the lead author adds those after verification.
- Do not mention "the book says" in content; write as a teacher would.
- Keep every section between roughly 250 and 700 words of content. Vary block types; every section needs at least 2 `callout` blocks (one `exam`, and one `pearl` or `caution`).
- JSON-safe strings: escape double quotes inside strings with \" and avoid raw newlines inside strings.

## Guide section format
Each work file is a JS object literal in parentheses, exactly like this:

```
({
  title: "<part title>",
  sections: [
    { id: "s291-xxx", title: "...", blocks: [ ... ] },
    ...
  ]
})
```

Block types (use only these):
- `{ type: "p", text: "..." }` — a paragraph.
- `{ type: "h", text: "..." }` — a sub-heading inside a long section (use sparingly).
- `{ type: "list", title?: "...", items: ["...", "..."] }` — bullet list.
- `{ type: "defs", title?: "...", items: [["Term", "Definition ..."], ...] }` — term/definition pairs.
- `{ type: "table", caption: "...", head: ["col", ...], rows: [["...", ...], ...], note?: "...", wide?: true }` — set `wide: true` when 4+ columns.
- `{ type: "steps", title: "...", items: [["Step name", "What happens"], ...] }` — ordered sequence.
- `{ type: "callout", kind: "exam" | "pearl" | "caution", title: "...", text: "..." }` — exam = board-style key fact; pearl = clinical insight; caution = pitfall/safety.
- `{ type: "case", title: "Mrs. B, a year of unrelieved yearning", text: "<paraphrased vignette>", point: "<teaching point, 1-2 sentences>" }`

Section ids: use exactly the ids given in your prompt. Titles: as given (you may polish wording slightly).

## Card formats (for card agents)
One file, a JS object literal in parentheses:
```
({
hy: [ { id: "hy291-xx", topic: "Topic name", items: ["one key fact with **bold** answer", ...] }, ... ],
dx: [ { id: "d291-xx01", tag: "Tag", q: "question", a: "answer with **bold** key words" }, ... ],
cs: [ { id: "c291-xx01", tag: "Tag", q: "clinical vignette ending in a question (single best answer)", choices: ["A","B","C","D","E"], answer: 0, why: "why the answer is right; cite the section or table" }, ... ],
ph: [ { id: "p291-xx01", tag: "Tag", q: "...", a: "..." }, ... ],
fd: [ { id: "f291-xx01", tag: "Tag", q: "...", a: "..." }, ... ]
})
```
- `answer` is the index (0 to 4) of the correct choice in the order you wrote it; the build shuffles later. Vary which position is correct.
- Exactly 5 choices, all plausible, same grammatical form, no "all of the above".
- Vignettes: realistic, 2 to 4 sentences, with age and a clear clinical question ("What is the most likely diagnosis?", "Which is the best next step?", "Which drug is most likely responsible?"). Use the stem only to carry the facts needed; the `why` must be supported by the chapter.
- dx = clinical facts: indications, contraindications, patient selection, technique, goals, limitations, outcomes; ph = pharmacology only where the source discusses medication (for example medication as an adjunct); fd = foundations: theory, concepts, mechanisms of change, terms, named founders and history; hy = high-yield one-liners grouped by topic (8 to 20 items per topic).
- Ids: use the two-letter prefix given in your prompt for each topic, numbered 01, 02, ... with no gaps.
- Tags: use only the tags listed in your prompt.

## Self-check before you finish
Run `node -e 'const o=eval(require("fs").readFileSync("<file>","utf8")); ...'` to confirm the file parses, that every block has a known type, that every case has 5 choices and a valid answer index, that ids are unique and that the section ids match the list you were given. Print the counts.

## Chapter 29 rules (strict)
- COPYRIGHT (most important): every word you write must be your own. Never copy a book sentence or a run of more than about six consecutive book words, in the guide, tables, cards or explanations. Short technical terms, terms of art, statute and case names (for example "Uniform Determination of Death Act", "anticipatory grief", "double effect") are fine, but shorten long names in your own sentences. Do not print long passages of the source in your tool calls or your final reply either: read the file, take notes in your head, write in your own words.
- OVERLAP CHECK (mandatory before you finish): run `N=7 DETAIL=/tmp/ov-<yourjob>.tsv python3 /home/claude/tools/overlap.py <clean source named in your job> <your g file> <your c file>` and reword until it reports 0 runs. Delete the TSV before each re-run (DETAIL appends). Report the final count.
- TABLES: turn each book table into a comparison or summary table written in your own words. Keep the same columns and rows and every key fact, but rephrase each cell briefly; do not copy cell wording. Caption it with the book table number ("... (see Table 29-2)").
- Coverage beats brevity. Every fact, number, named person, year, statute, stage, type, term and study result in your source should appear somewhere in your guide sections and be tested by at least one card. A coverage audit checks this afterwards.
- NAMED PEOPLE, MODELS AND STAGES: give each named model (for example stage or phase schemes), named author, statute or court case its own line in a `defs`, `steps` or `table` block, as the source gives it (spelling and years included). Where the source contrasts things (for example normal grief versus depression, or the bereavement approach of two classifications), add a comparison table. If a name, year, number or claim in the source looks wrong or outdated, keep it and flag it in your final report.
- Section length: 350 to 900 words of content (sections drawn from very short source text may be shorter, about 250). Every section needs at least 3 `callout` blocks (at least one `exam`, one `pearl`, one `caution`).
- The book's clinical vignettes become `case` blocks: paraphrase and shorten them in your own words, de-identify, and keep the point the book makes.
- Keep the book's level of certainty. Where the source says something is debated, varies by state or country, or is unsettled, say exactly that. Do not add verdicts of your own. Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are CONTESTED: attribute every argument and position to whoever holds it in the source (for example the AMA, Oregon voters, the Netherlands, critics, supporters), set opposing arguments side by side, and never write the app's own opinion.
- Law: the source describes mainly US law (and sometimes the Netherlands or other countries). Keep it as the source gives it and say "in the United States" (or the state or country named) where it is jurisdiction-specific. Do not add Philippine law or any law, statute status or count of states that the source does not give; the lead author adds verified updates afterwards.
- Classification: where the source describes DSM-5 or ICD-10 rules on bereavement or complicated grief, keep them as the source gives them, labeled with the edition. Do not write DSM-5-TR or ICD-11 rules (prolonged grief disorder); the lead author adds those in update boxes. Do not use as a correct answer any statement that the newer classifications have since reversed (for example "complicated grief is not a diagnosis"); test what the book says about DSM-5 or ICD-10 as "according to DSM-5" instead.
- Card targets for your part: hy 3 to 5 topics of 10 to 20 items; dx at least 6 per 1,000 source words; cs at least 6 vignettes per 1,000 source words (about 3 to 5 per section); fd at least 10 (named models, people, terms, laws and history go here); ph 0 to 6 only where the source discusses medication (do not invent drug facts or doses).
- Cases should test application: telling normal grief from major depression or from complicated grief and its types, the stage or phase a person is in, how a child of a given age understands death, criteria for brain death, the kind of help a bereaved person needs, what a law or professional body permits or requires, and how a physician should respond to a request.
- A wrong choice must be wrong everywhere in the chapter. Do not use as a distractor something another part of the source treats as acceptable.
- Doses and numbers: keep every number, time limit, percentage and age exactly as the source gives it; flag any that looks wrong in your final report instead of changing it.
- Outdated terms in the source stay as written, with a short note in your own words that the current term differs where you are sure of it (do not state new rules).
- Vignettes: realistic and varied (ages, settings, sexes). Every fact the question depends on must come from your source.
- No post-publication updates and no `update` blocks.
- FINAL REPORT (short, no source quotes): counts per section and card type, the final overlap count, and a list of anything in the source that looked wrong, outdated, garbled or contradictory.
