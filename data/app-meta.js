/* Key migration is NOT used here. Kaplan keeps its storage prefix "ks:v1:" and every key under it exactly as
   before (srs, mistakes, bookmarks, examHistory, teachSessions, prefs, theme, textSize...). The only key whose
   shape changed is "seenNews" (an integer changelog id before, a version string now); js/app.js reads an old
   integer as "seen up to that release". Leave window.MIGRATE_KEYS undefined. */
